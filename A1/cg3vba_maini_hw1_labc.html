    <p> Ingredients </p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound dry spaghetti</li>
      <li>4 ounces pancetta</li>
      <li>2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Preparation </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until tender yet firm.</li>
      <li>Heat the olive oil in a deep skillet over medium flame. Add the pancetta and saute for about 3 minutes, until the bacon is crisp and the fat is rendered. Toss the garlic into the fat and saute for less than 1 minute to soften.</li>
      <li>Add the hot, drained spaghetti to the pan and toss for 2 minutes to coat the strands in the bacon fat. Beat the eggs and Parmesan together in a mixing bowl, stirring well to prevent lumps.</li>
      <li>Remove the pan from the heat and pour the egg/cheese mixture into the pasta, whisking quickly until the eggs thicken, but do not scramble.</li>
      <li> Thin out the sauce with a bit of the reserved pasta water, until it reaches desired consistency. Mound the spaghetti carbonara into warm serving bowls and garnish with chopped parsley.</li>
    </ol>
